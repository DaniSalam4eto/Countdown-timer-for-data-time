# Countdown Timer

The Countdown Timer script for Unity allows you to create a countdown timer that displays the remaining days, hours, and minutes. The timer's state is saved to a file so that it persists across application sessions.

## Features

- **Customizable initial countdown time** (days, hours, minutes).
- **Displays the remaining time** in a `TextMeshProUGUI` element.
- **Saves and loads the countdown state** to/from a file.
- **Handles application pause, quit, and focus events** to ensure accurate time tracking.

## Setup

### Add the Script to a GameObject

1. Attach the `Countdown` script to a GameObject in your Unity scene.

### Assign UI Elements

1. Create a `TextMeshProUGUI` element in your scene to display the countdown timer.
2. Assign this `TextMeshProUGUI` element to the `countdownText` field in the script.

### Set Initial Time

1. In the Inspector, set the `daysLeft`, `hoursLeft`, and `minutesLeft` fields to define the initial countdown duration.

## Usage

### Running the Scene

- When you run the scene, the countdown will start from the specified time.
- The remaining time will be displayed in the format: `Time Left: 00d 00h 00m`.
- When the countdown reaches zero, it will display `Time's Up!`.

### Persistence

- The countdown state is saved to a file located at `Application.persistentDataPath + "/countdown.txt"`.
- The timer state is saved when the application is paused, loses focus, or quits.
- On restarting the application, the countdown will resume from the last saved state.

## Notes

- Ensure that the TextMeshPro package is installed in your Unity project.
- Customize the display format or behavior as needed by modifying the script.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a basic setup example:

1. Create a new GameObject in the scene and name it `CountdownTimer`.
2. Attach the `Countdown` script to the `CountdownTimer` GameObject.
3. Create a UI Text element using TextMeshPro and assign it to the `countdownText` field of the script.
4. Set the initial time values (e.g., `daysLeft = 1`, `hoursLeft = 2`, `minutesLeft = 30`).
